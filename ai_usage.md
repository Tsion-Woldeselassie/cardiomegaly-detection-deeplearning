## Summary of AI Involvement

ChatGPT was used for the following purposes:

### 1. Debugging Assistance
- Helped identify the cause of Google Colab runtime crashes.
- Suggested lighter model architectures when EfficientNetB7 exceeded memory limits.
- Assisted in fixing Python errors such as mismatched paths, incorrect DataFrame handling, and tensor shape mismatches.

### 2. Clarifying Code Behavior
- Explained TensorFlow/Keras functions when documentation was unclear.
- Provided interpretations of model outputs (loss curves, accuracy trends).

### 3. Writing Support
- Helped organize the draft project report.
- Reformatted text for clarity and technical accuracy.
- Proofread explanations for readability.

## Ethical & Privacy Considerations

- The dataset used is public, anonymized, and compliant with ethical research standards.
- No personal or private data was accessed.
- The model is for educational and research purposes only and is not a clinical diagnostic tool.
